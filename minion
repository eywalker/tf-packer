# File Server Backend
#
# Salt supports a modular fileserver backend system, this system allows
# the salt master to link directly to third party systems to gather and
# manage the files available to minions. Multiple backends can be
# configured and will be searched for the requested file in the order in which
# they are defined here. The default setting only enables the standard backend
# "roots" which uses the "file_roots" option.
fileserver_backend:
  - git
  - roots

# Git File Server Backend Configuration
#
# Optional parameter used to specify the provider to be used for gitfs. Must
# be one of the following: pygit2, gitpython, or dulwich. If unset, then each
# will be tried in that same order, and the first one with a compatible
# version installed will be the provider that is used.
gitfs_provider: gitpython

# When using the git fileserver backend at least one git remote needs to be
# defined. The user running the salt master will need read access to the repo.
#
# The repos will be searched in order to find the file requested by a client
# and the first repo to have the file will return it.
# When using the git backend branches and tags are translated into salt
# environments.
# Note: file:// repos will be treated as a remote, so refs you want used must
# exist in that repo as *local* refs.
